            <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

          <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

          <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

          <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p> -->

            </p>

            <p>
              Prequisutes: Range Query Tree(Segment Tree or Fenwick Tree), Line
              Sweep Algorithm intuition
            </p>

            <p>
              Explaination: We can imagine Problem to be some set of adjacent
              towers and wires connecting adjacent towers. Each tower has
              different height.
            </p>
            <p>
              When ever a query is asked you can assume that a light is to be
              shot from x1 to x2 at height h. Which is pretty straight forward.
              <br />
              While processing a query what must be done? here we must be quite
              strategic. here we need to process the queries offline.
            </p>
            <p>
              now we need to think of lines as some structure. for each line we
              define a start point, end point. Starting point is the point on
              with higher y cordinate and end is the one with lower y cordinate.
              if a line is horiczontal we consider the left point as start point
              and right point as end point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guess where we are headed! Split the line. Start point and end
              Point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we need to define some points as events points. These is where
              we do some computaion for our queries. here start point, end point
              and queries are the event points.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now decide how to process the event points. In the mean while we
              will define our event point staructre. First Observation We need
              to process the event points from Top to Bottom by height. If the
              events have same height we need to process start points first,
              then queries and finally the end points.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a start point is detected we add 1 at the left idx of the
              line. When a end point is detected we substract 1 from left idx of
              the line. when a query is detected we do a range query on the left
              idx and right idx-1 of the query(Finally store then by their query
              idx). If range query is done slowly we will fail. So we need to
              use Segment Tree or Fenwick Tree(Link to refernce in the roadmap
              section).
