            Get initial count of even bit numbers(x) and odd bit numbers(y) present in array.
            <br />
            When a query P comes check whether P is even bit number or odd bit number, if P is even bit number print
            x and y else print y and x.

            Prequisutes: Basic Graph Traversal Algorithm, Observation
          </p>

          <p>
            Explaination: Well I have seen many programmers hardcoding solution. Solution I am going to present is quite
            general and works even
            with N X N chessboard with some modification to solution presented below. Solution presented below is based
            on
            graph traversal algorithm
            called DFS(Depth First Search).
          </p>
          <p>
            Construct a graph which is not going to change with testcases, (u,v) where u = (a,b), v = (c,d) is an
            undirected
            edge in graph if u and v represents
            black cell and bishop can move from u to v and from v to u beforehand. This can be constructed in O(N X N)
            time
            for general N X N chessboard.
            <br />
            Whenever a query src = (r,c) comes keep a counter rem(here initially rem = 32), perform a DFS considering
            src
            as root and keep on
            pushing
            cells in ans array till rem
            becomes 0.
            <br />
            Finally print the ans array.
            <br />
            Main observation here is number of cell visited will not become greater than 64 each cell is visited atmost
            twice
            and number of black cell is 32
            so number of cell visited is always less than equal to 64 (loose upper bound).
          </p>

          <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

          <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

          <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

          <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p> -->

          <p>
            Prequisutes: Range Query Tree(Segment Tree or Fenwick Tree), Line
            Sweep Algorithm intuition
          </p>

          <p>
            Explaination: We can imagine Problem to be some set of adjacent
            towers and wires connecting adjacent towers. Each tower has
            different height.
          </p>
          <p>
            When ever a query is asked you can assume that a light is to be
            shot from x1 to x2 at height h. Which is pretty straight forward.
            <br />
            While processing a query what must be done? here we must be quite
            strategic. here we need to process the queries offline.
          </p>
          <p>
            now we need to think of lines as some structure. for each line we
            define a start point, end point. Starting point is the point on
            with higher y cordinate and end is the one with lower y cordinate.
            if a line is horizontal we consider the left point as start point
            and right point as end point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guess where we are headed! Split the line. Start point and end
            Point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we need to define some points as events points. These is where
            we do some computaion for our queries. here start point, end point
            and queries are the event points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now decide how to process the event points. In the mean while we
            will define our event point staructre. First Observation We need
            to process the event points from Top to Bottom by height. If the
            events have same height we need to process start points first,
            then queries and finally the end points.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a start point is detected we add 1 at the left idx of the
            line. When a end point is detected we substract 1 from left idx of
            the line. when a query is detected we do a range query on the left
            idx and right idx-1 of the query(Finally store then by their query
            idx). If range query is done slowly we will fail. So we need to
            use Segment Tree or Fenwick Tree(Link to refernce in the roadmap
            section).
